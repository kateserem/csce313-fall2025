the client transfers files in fixed 256 chiunks
each chunk requires a request and a reply over the FIFO
the more bytes there the more chunks which means more round trips
resulting in a roughly growth linearly with the file size
so time is proportional to the file size under 256 byte messages

in the image we see an immediate slop change at 10^7
at this size the file is broken into many pieces
meaning for each piece it takes a little more time for every piece
hence why we see an increase in the slope

so at 10^7 bytes the change in the slope is where the time cost per chunk outweigh the fixed startup time cost
